## About Me

Hello, I am a high school student, I am not currently working.

I am a person who likes to learn new things, I am currently learning Java and perfecting it since my goal is to be a Back-End developer. Much earlier, I programmed simple add-ons for the open source Minecraft Bedrock software Pocket-Mine and in my spare time I developed Discord bots in JavaScript. I'm going to dedicate myself professionally to this.

I hope we see each other soon.
